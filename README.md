## Packages, Libraries and RTOSes

### Communication

#### Ethernet 

- [lwIP](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) - lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite that has been initially developed by Adam Dunkels. Supports DHCP with AutoIP fallback, UDP, TCP, and an interrupt driven model.
- [uIP](https://github.com/adamdunkels/uip) - A very tiny IP stack, but also a very minimal IP stack. (Not maintained anymore)

#### CAN

- [CANopenNode](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode) - CANopenNode is written in ANSI C in object-oriented way. It runs on different microcontrollers, as standalone application or with RTOS

#### Serialization

- [nanopb](https://koti.kapsi.fi/jpa/nanopb/) - Nanopb is a plain-C implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers data format. It is targeted at 32 bit microcontrollers, but is also fit for other embedded systems with tight (2-10 kB ROM, <1 kB RAM) memory constraints.
- [mpack](https://github.com/ludocode/mpack) - A C encoder/decoder for [MessagePack](http://msgpack.com) messages suitable for resource constriants embedded systems. Supports disabling dynamic memory allocation and overriding malloc, free, and realloc.

- [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/)  - A free OS for IoT devices providing foundational trust services. The trust services include device identity, sealing, attestation, and data integrity. The term “Robust” is used because the minimal trusted computing base is tiny, and because RIoT capabilities can remotely re-establish trust in devices that have been compromised by malware.
- [Rocket](http://www.windriver.com/products/operating-systems/rocket/) - A free embedded operating system specifically designed to quickly and easily build small, intelligent devices in Wind Rivers cloud-based development environment, Wind River Helix™ App Cloud.
- [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/) - Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems or RTEMS is an open source Real Time Operating System (RTOS) that supports open standard application programming interfaces (API) such as POSIX. It is used in space flight, medical, networking and many more embedded devices using processor architectures including ARM, PowerPC, Intel, Blackfin, MIPS, Microblaze and more.
- [Nucleus RTOS](https://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/nucleus/) - Commercial, highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for scalability and reliability.
- [uC/os](https://www.micrium.com/rtos/kernels/) - µC/OS-II and µC/OS-III are preemptive, highly portable, and scalable real-time kernels. You can test them out for free, but you must pay to put them into a product.
- [Fuschia](https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/magenta) - Magenta is the core platform that powers the Fuchsia OS. Magenta is composed of a microkernel (source in kernel/...) as well as a small set of userspace services, drivers, and libraries (source in system/...) necessary for the system to boot, talk to hardware, load userspace processes and run them, etc. Fuchsia builds a much larger OS on top of this foundation.
- [TI-RTOS](www.ti.com/tool/ti-rtos) - A real-time operating system for TI microcontrollers, It Includes TCP/IP and USB stacks, a FAT file system, and device drivers, Most of the TI-RTOS components are released under the BSD License.

- [Mockitopp](https://github.com/tpounds/mockitopp) - A C++ mocking framework inspired by the ideas developed for Mockito written by Szczepan Faber, et al. The purpose is to provide similar construction semantics for creating mock objects leading to smaller, more readable test cases. It is designed to be a lightweight framework allowing you to mock dependencies for a system under test using a simple descriptive domain specific language. The goal is to help create simpler, less brittle test cases; ultimately, leading to less maintenance overhead in the future.
